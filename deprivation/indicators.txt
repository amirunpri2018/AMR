Indicator: 92377
Description:  Twelve month rolling total number of prescribed antibiotic items per STAR-PU by Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) within England.
Methodology:  Numerator is divided by the denominator (items divided by STAR-PU)
Unit:  per STAR-PU
Numerator:  Total number of antibiotic items prescribedin practices located within the area. An item is an antibiotic (from British National Formulary Section 5.1) that is prescribed in a primary care settingA prescription item refers to a single item prescribed by a prescriber on a prescription form (known as an FP10). If a prescription form includes three medicines it is counted as three prescription items. The number of items is a measure of how often a prescriber has decided to write a prescription. It is often used when we wish to look at prescriber behaviour as every prescription is an opportunity to change treatment. For vaccinations and acute treatment (for example, a short course of antibiotics) the item is also a reasonable measure of the number of courses of treatment.GP practice counts of items are aggregated to CCG
Denominator:  STAR-PU are weighted units to allow comparisons adjusting for the age and sex of patients distribution of each practice.
Production:  nan

Indicator: 92350
Description:  Twelve month rolling percentage of prescribed antibiotic items from cephalosporin, quinolone and co-amoxiclav class.
Methodology:  The percentage of broad spectrum antibiotic in antibiotic prescribing. Total consumptionof cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone and co-amoxiclavantibiotics divided by the aggregated total of the sub set of antibiotic prescribing made up of BNF 5.1 category.
Unit:  %
Numerator:  Cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone and co-amoxiclav, are broad spectrum antimicrobials. These form an important category for prescribing surveillance.
